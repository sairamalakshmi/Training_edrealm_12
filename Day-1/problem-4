#Bit-wise operators
#&#This operator performs a bitwise AND operation between two integers.
#/#This operator performs a bitwise OR operation between two integers.

#Shift operators
#>>#This operator performs a right shift operation on an integer, shifting its bits to the right by a specified number of positions.
# Formula:n*2**k, where n is the original number and k is the number of positions to shift.        
#<<#This operator performs a left shift operation on an integer, shifting its bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
# Formula:n//2**k, where n is the original number and k is the number of positions to shift.


## Problem 4: Count the number of set bits in a given integer
#This function counts the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a given integer n.
